Successes are few and far in between, platforms are only just maturing and there are as many stories of failed delivery as there are of delayed delivery.\nAnd yet, it is proving enormously popular — especially among hardware startups. It would appear as if everyone wants to crowdfund. But should they?\nA successful crowdfunding campaign promises to be an utopian ideal — funds to develop the product and buyers to take them off you!\n\nBut when you need to develop the product is precisely where the promise fails.\n\nCrowdfunding raises money through pre-orders and unless your overall profits are sufficiently high you will not have capital for research and development. Only enough to buy material, make and deliver.\nI have lost count of the number of startups who estimate pricing based on material and labour expenses. Anything sufficiently new and innovative which excites people needs a lot of expensive iterations. Building supply chains needs trials and perhaps travel to establish the right networks. Building great user experiences needs a lot of research. So on and so forth.\nIn a typical product you ammortise these costs over multiple sales cycles and often, multiple versions of your product. Crowdfunding doesn’t leave a lot of room for discovery.\nOne often paints the destination and promises the most beautiful sunrise but doesn’t know how to get there.\nSo when does it&nbsp;work?\nWith most products costs are a function of volume. For instance, one particular startup we support knows that they can lower procurement cost by over 50% if only they could go to volumes of 1000 units and over. More importantly, they already know how to make the product and with those volumes they can tap into an established, trustworthy supply chain.\nHow awesome is that? They could split those savings with their customer and still increase their net profitability.\nThis is where I believe crowdfunding can deliver the utopian ideal — if you can pull off that large demand. Use every howto trick out there and get those 1000 buyers!\nBut first, know your way to the destination.\n","id":"https://tej.sh/blog/crowdfund/","title":"To crowdfund or not to crowdfund"},"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-after-install/":{"body":"Frappe ships with a number of workspaces and roles out of the box. These workspaces have short cuts for a number of core system functionality including managing users and integrations. However, we almost never use these shortcuts - instead preferring the search bar. \nThe roles are more problematic as they include a number of roles that have no business being in a core web framework, e.g. \"Purchase User\". These are clearly an ERPNext legacy. They can lead to confusion when creating your own roles later. As a rule, we don't use any of these roles when building our apps to avoid leaking privileges if we install any other Frappe app or install our app alongside ERPNext.\nTo simplify matters, we use a post-install hook in our apps to clean up these workspaces and roles.

Like it, or not, these hooks are how one writes Frappe code. So, the ORM is critical on the write-path, if (far) less efficient than raw SQL writes. We have previously explored this topic for bulk writes.\nSome of our apps have read heavy APIs where a number of documents are read during a single API transaction. Until recently we had no choice but to choose one of the following:\n\nUse frappe.get_doc and accept the performance penalty, \nWrite raw SQL queries and combine multiple reads into a single DB transaction,\nRoll our own caching and carefully manage invalidations.\n\nBrave new world\nHowever, I recently discovered frappe.get_cached_doc and it's essentially a free performance upgrade. The documentation is pretty straightforward:\n\nthe return value of get_cached_doc is equivalent to the return value of get_doc\nthe cache is updated any time the ORM is used to update the document (doc.save or frappe.db.set_value)\n\nRaw DB updates and doc.db_set do not update the cache. This does mean our bulk_insert method does not update the cache. Thankfully, there's frappe.clear_document_cache(doctype, name)\n\n\n\nPerformance upgrades\nWhat does this mean in terms of performance? A cool 10000x+ increase in read throughput. See the code below for my simplistic benchmark.\n\nfrom timeit import timeit\n\ndef load_doc():\n    return frappe.get_doc(doctype, docname)\n\ndef load_cached_doc():\n    return frappe.get_cached_doc(doctype, docname)\n\nprint(timeit(load_doc, number=1000))\n# 17.63\n\n\nprint(timeit(load_cached_doc, number=10000000))\n# 13.00\n\n\nSure, caching documents needs more RAM. But RAM is dirt cheap these days, so go ahead and replace frappe.get_doc with frappe.get_cached_doc in your performance critical paths and enjoy an immediate boost to API responsiveness.\n","id":"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-cached-doc/","title":"ORM Speed Up In Frappe"},"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-deferred-bulk/":{"body":"One of our upcoming SaaS products handles delivery payout calculations for ecommerce companies.\nHere, we accept bulk imports of trip and order data for the previous day and then calculate payouts\nusing fairly complex, dark-store specific rate cards.

So, imagine my surprise when ChatGPT suggested\nI try out frappe.db.bulk_insert. At first, I assumed GPT was up to its hallucinatory tricks again\nbut I decided to see if such a function existed and what do you know!\nOf Undocumented Needles In Haystacks\nFrappe has a built-in ORM \nthat serves us well for most of the common use cases. There are also a few extras that \nare not as commonly used in the Frappe or ERPNext code bases and perhaps not as familiar \nto developers:\n\nQuery builder\nbuilt on top of Pypika - useful for replacing SQL queries with a more Pythonic API\nDeferred Inserts - \nthis uses Redis as an aggregation layer and flushes writes to the DB using an hourly task.\nBulk Inserts - \nthis function is used once outside tests in the entire Frappe code base and that too inside a patch \nfor v12. And not at all inside ERPNext.\n\nChatGPT found this function. I doubt I ever would have.\n75 Lines Of Python\nMy current solution for handling the file imports consists of combining deferred_insert and bulk_insert.\nHere's the workflow before we dive into the code:\n\nUser attaches 2-3 bulk files to a custom doctype (e.g. Trip Report).\nUsing document hooks we parse the files row by row to look for validation errors.\nWe create (in-memory) instances of the doctype we are importing (e.g. Trip).\nWe serialise these documents and store them in a Redis list.\nOnce completely parsed, we retrieve the documents from Redis and bulk write them \nto the DB in batches.\n\nSteps 1 - 3 are trivial and common enough that we can skip those. \nTo handle 4 and 5, I have a DB helper module adapted from the deferred_insert module linked above.\n# db.py\n\nqueue_prefix = \"some_prefix_\"\n\n\ndef get_key_name(key: str) -&gt; str:\n    return cstr(key).split(\"|\")[1]\n\n\ndef deferred_insert(doc):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a Frappe document to JSON and stores it in a Redis list.\n    \"\"\"\n    doctype = doc.doctype\n    docname = doc.name\n    if not (doctype and docname):\n        frappe.throw(\"Doctype and Docname are required\")\n    redis_key = f\"{queue_prefix}{doctype}\"\n    d = doc.as_dict()\n    skip = [\"docstatus\", \"doctype\", \"idx\"]\n    for key in list(d.keys()):\n        if key.startswith('_'):\n            d.pop(key)\n        if key in skip:\n            d.pop(key)\n    frappe.cache().rpush(redis_key, frappe.as_json(d))\n\n\ndef bulk_insert(doctype):\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves JSON documents from a Redis list and bulk inserts in the DB in batches.\n    \"\"\"\n    redis_key = f\"{queue_prefix}{doctype}\"\n    queue_keys = frappe.cache().get_keys(redis_key)\n    record_count = 0\n    unique_names = set()\n    records = []\n    for key in queue_keys:\n        queue_key = get_key_name(key)\n        while frappe.cache().llen(queue_key) &gt; 0:\n            record = frappe.cache().lpop(queue_key)\n            record = json.loads(record.decode(\"utf-8\"))\n            if isinstance(record, dict):\n                record_count += 1\n                if record['name'] in unique_names:\n                    continue\n                unique_names.add(record['name'])\n                records.append(record)\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid record\")\n    if records:\n        for batch in create_batch(records, 1000):\n            fields = list(batch[0].keys())\n            values = (tuple(record.values()) for record in batch)\n            frappe.db.bulk_insert(doctype, fields, values)\n    frappe.db.commit()\n    print(f\"Inserted {record_count} records\")\n    return record_count\n\n\ndef clear_queue(doctype):\n    \"\"\"\n    Clear the queue in case we are reprocessing the same import file.\n    \"\"\"\n    redis_key = f\"{queue_prefix}{doctype}\"\n    frappe.cache().delete_keys(redis_key)\n\n\ndef bulk_delete(doctype, docnames):\n    \"\"\"\n    Delete records in bulk.

You can do this with vanilla JS as long as you have \nFrappe's JS bundle available (included in the default web.html template).\nI had issues establishing the realtime connection without waiting for a few seconds, \nhence the setTimeout.\n\nServer\nFrappe bundles socket.io on the server side to handle realtime communications over websockets.\nAs a developer, you interact with the simple Python API.\nIn our example above, all we did to send updates was:\nfor i in range(100):\n    frappe.publish_realtime(event=\"count\", user=\"Administrator\", message={\"count\": i})\n    sleep(1)\n\nHow does it work?\nThe Python API is fairly simple and contained entirely in realtime.py.\nThis file is worth a read. The Python side communicates with the Socket.IO server using its Redis Adapter.\nIn order to route the messages, Frappe uses \"rooms\" which are specific to tasks/documents or users.\nThere's even a site wide broadcast room. At the Redis level, the room is just a key in the JSON\nstructure that is sent to events PubSub channel (see emit_via_redis inside realtime.py).\nOnce an event has been published to Redis, the Socket.IO adapter picks it up and broadcasts it \nto subscribed clients. Socket.IO uses Websockets for client communication with a fallback to HTTP \nlongpolling. Socket.IO's documentation is pretty \nfantastic at explaining the internals.\n\nFinally, to make it all work, Frappe's web bundle includes a Socket.IO client\nthat handles authentication, authorization, reconnects, subscriptions and publishing. \nYes, clients can send messages to the server too. That's for a later post.\n\nBtw, Frappe's realtime code is getting a bit of a rewrite in the develop branch as we speak.\n\nWhat can you use it for?\nFrappe uses it for presence (showing who else is viewing a document), updating list views and \nshowing progress when uploading files or importing data.\nWe use it for sending asynchronous realtime updates to our webviews, even those embedded \nin our mobile apps. We have long planned to migrate our workflow apps over to Phoenix but that's \na lot of work and these realtime capabilisties significantly reduce the value of doing that.\nThat said, Phoenix LiveView is an absolute joy to work with and gives you much simpler ways\nto architect your application and reason about the realtime pieces.\n","id":"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-realtime/","title":"Realtime Webviews With Frappe"},"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-restic/":{"body":"Built-in backup and restore\nfunctionality is definitely one of Frappe's nicer features. Having used bench restore to move\nservers and, once, recover from a failed server I can vouch for its efficacy.\nA Frappe site is fully backed up if you have backups for the application code, DB, files and the site_config.json.\nAll our application code is on Github and a couple of computers so we will focus on the others.\nThe default bench backup creates snapshot tar.gz files for the DB, public files and private files. Based on the \nselected routine, it will also take snapshots of the site_config.json file. You can even configure \nFrappe to store the backups on AWS S3 - this works really well and will email you if the backup fails for some reason.\n\nsite_config.json is quite important to back up as it contains the DB password as well as the \nencryption key needed to decode passwords stored in the DB.\n\nHowever, this approach also results in a lot of wasted disk space and cost on S3 (or wherever you are keeping your backups).\nEach set of tar.gz files is a standalone backup and hence contains all the data needed to restore your site.\nDo this once a day and soon your S3 bill has 2 digits on it. Do this 4 times a day and you will be paying more for S3\nthan your servers. Sure, you could rotate the backups (manually, Frappe doesn't have built-in support) \nbut we can do better - and spend fewer CPU cycles.\nNow, with our servers seeing a lot more traffic and databases extending into the 10s of GB, I felt\nwe needed a slightly more custom solution. I have used Tarsnap in the past and that was my preferred \nsolution but then came across this podcast interview with the creator of Restic.\nA quick search on the Frappe forum led me to this post \nwhich covers much the same things as this blog post.\nThe main difference between the forum post and my setup is that we don't use bench backup at all.\nInstead, we use mysqldump to create the DB snapshot (same as bench backup, without the tar.gz) and backup the site directory in its entirety - files and config.\n\nSpecifically, the timestamped tar.gz files created by bench backup are considered to be new files by Restic and this would defeat the purpose of using Restic.\n\nOur approach is simpler and has the advantage of being more suited to restic which can be smart about the changes in the files and do proper incremental backups.\nThe Restic docs do a great job explaining how to get started - from initialising a repo to doing backups and restores. Read that to get a better understanding of Restic before using/adapting this script.\nBackup Script\nrestic.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n# Keep your exports in /etc/profile or similar\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=SOME_KEY\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=SOME_SECRET\nexport AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-south-1\nexport RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE=/path/to/restic.password\nBUCKET=SOME_BUCKET\nSITES=( site_1 site_2 site_3 )\nDB_USER=SOME_DB_USER\nDB_PASSWORD=SOME_DB_PASSWORD\nfor FRAPPE_SITE in \"${SITES[@]}\"\ndo\n\techo \"Backing Up $FRAPPE_SITE\"\n\tDIR_PATH=frappe-bench/sites/$FRAPPE_SITE\n\tDB_NAME=`cat $DIR_PATH/site_config.json | jq -r '.db_name'`\n\tmysqldump --single-transaction --quick --lock-tables=false \\\n        -u $DB_USER -p$DB_PASSWORD $DB_NAME &gt; $DIR_PATH/private/backups/$DB_NAME.sql\n\tRESTIC_URL=\"s3:s3.amazonaws.com/$BUCKET/restic/$FRAPPE_SITE\"\n\trestic -r $RESTIC_URL list snapshots || restic -r $RESTIC_URL init\n\trestic -r $RESTIC_URL backup $PWD/frappe-bench/sites/$FRAPPE_SITE\n\ttouch last_backup_$FRAPPE_SITE.timestamp\ndone\n\nHere's a brief explainer:\n\nThe env variables should go wherever you normally put your environment variables. DO NOT keep them in the script - that's an invitation for a breach at some later day.\nWe are assuming there's a single DB user and password that can be used to access the DB for each\nsite. If not, you can also read the user and password from site_config.json\nYou will need to install both restic and jq - e.g. apt install restic jq\nThe mysqldump command is adapted from that used by bench backup. Be sure to use --quick - this helps keep memory usage down and can help prevent OOM crashes.\nWe use the logical OR || to initialise the Restic repo if not already done. \nOnce the backup is completed, we use a simple timestamp to track when the last backup was completed.\n\nI add this script to my Cron with crontab -e as an hourly task. This means I have more frequent backups and pay less than with the default bench backup approach. Admittedly, I can no longer use bench restore but on the other hand, all I have to do is restic -r &lt;repo&gt; restore &lt;snapshot&gt; --target &lt;target-dir&gt; and mysql &lt;db-name&gt; &lt; backup.sql.\n","id":"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-restic/","title":"Incremental Backups For Frappe Using Restic"},"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-user-doctype-report/":{"body":"In a Frappe site with 100s of users and 10s of DocTypes, ensuring everyone has appropriate access levels can quickly get quite tricky.

And the more I look into it the more I realise it has the potential to revolutionise research.\nResearch projects either succeed or disappear. Research that translates to profits makes headlines. The rest is similar to the lonely tree that fell in the forest.\nEvery product development has multiple layers that need to be developed — technology, application and market. Of these, the fundamental technology is rarely the one that delivers actual business value. Profits derive from how we use the technology (i.e. the application layer) and how we sell the application (i.e. the market layer). A product can fail in any of these layers but the technology layer is probably easiest to fix. Especially since we have a ready-made reference model from the software world.\nThe founders behind Github decided early on that they would open source (almost) everything. They opened up technology building blocks to leverage the community for traction and product improvement. This act of thought leadership benefits the community by giving it something useful and more widely applicable. In order to build profitability the founders kept the business layers proprietary — e.g. the actual Github app.\n\nGithub’s lesson: Open source everything except that which represents core business value.\n\nThink about this for a while and reflect on any new product development you have worked upon. Do all layers need to be proprietary? Can we benefit from opening up specific building blocks early in the project? I think if we did open up:\n\n\nTechnology building blocks will develop faster and better with multiple experts contributing — we get to the application stage a lot quicker.\n\n\nWith enough traction these technology blocks will keep improving.\n\n\nPeople can use these open blocks for other projects and products we probably wouldn’t have thought or bothered about.\n\n\nProjects that aren’t quite successful are given a lifeline because someone, somewhere might fix shortcomings.

Quite a few of our apps can't afford downtime outside of specific,\nshort (&lt;30 minute) windows at odd off-peak hours. \nFor hotfixes in such cases, I have now started using a built-in feature of Gunicorn \nto do zero downtime updates when making Python code changes.\nThe documentation link above explains the flow quite well. Here's my workflow:\n\ngit pull inside the app directory, e.g. frappe-bench/apps/iotready_otp\nLook up the PID using htop after enabling tree view (F5) - the top PID from which the branches (workers) begin is the one we are after\nSend the following signals in sequence (you can, of course, send these from within the htop UI with F9):\n\nkill -USR2 &lt;pid&gt;\nkill -WINCH &lt;pid&gt;\nkill -TERM &lt;pid&gt;\n\n\n\nAnd that's it - workers are launched running the new Python code and existing workers will shutdown and exit once running requests are closed.\nEventually the master Gunicorn process exits too.\nThe documentation describes steps to revert back too (before sending the TERM signal). This is what your htop will look like during this process.\nPre USR2\nI have 10 workers branching from the master PID (12928).\n\nPost USR2\nA second master PID (12996) has been launched from the previous PID. This new Gunicorn process has its own workers.\n\nPost WINCH\nLooks the same as Post USR2 except the old workers have stopped taking requests.\nPost TERM\nThe old PID is gone and all we are left with is the new PID.\n\nMaking this a tad simpler\nThe reason we need all these steps is because Frappe uses a --preload flag by default when launching Gunicorn. This is configured \ninside the frappe-bench/config/supervisord.conf file. \n\nWithout the --preload flag, Gunicorn will do all of the above with just the HUP signal. However, sending a HUP also means that you \nwill lose the ability to revert.\n# Edit the supervisor.conf file to remove --preload\n# Reload the supervisor configuration\nsudo supervisorctl reload\n# Wait for processes to restart\nsudo supervisorctl signal HUP frappe-bench-web:frappe-bench-frappe-web\n\nI have chosen to keep --preload and use the manual process as it gives me a bit more control and I can see the changes happening. \nFrappe best practices\nThere are a few other Frappe working practices I follow to help with easier/graceful updates:\n\nUse versioning for APIs, e.g. new features or breaking changes go into api_v2.py so that the caller calls /api/method/app.api_v2.function\nExpand and then contract \nfor schema, e.g. when replacing or renaming fields, I add the new field, deploy it and once all clients (e.g. Android apps) \nare using the API and schema, I may remove the old fields. \nUse field/version based conditionals in document hooks. \n\n","id":"https://tej.sh/blog/graceful-gunicorn/","title":"Graceful Upgrades To Gunicorn Apps"},"https://tej.sh/blog/identity/":{"body":"\nWhat do you most commonly enter in that username field? Your email, your phone number?\nHold that thought. We will return to it.\nIn a previous post I explored why my privacy is more at risk when paying for a newspaper than when not. My proposals, however, were mostly wrong.\n\nOf logical fallacies\nSpecifically, I proposed the creation of a payment processor who would double as an identity provider (IDP). As @jackerhack pointed out, this puts too much power in the hands of the payment processor.\nIn reply, I proposed a flow that seemingly solves the privacy issues with the newspaper and the payment processor. Except, I got there through flawed logic.\nTo summarize:\n\nUser clicks on subscribe\nNewspaper sends user to a payment processor\nUser completes payment and is granted a random, generated token.\nThe same token is given to the newspaper which stores it as proof of subscription.\nUser is granted access anytime they present that token.\n\nThat bit about the generated token aside, the rest of the flow is exactly what already happens. So, the privacy \"gains\" result purely from using a random token to login instead of a username/password combination.\n\nBack to the top\nSo, that username field - what's your most common id? \nMine's an old email address. It's lasted me well over ten years - a constant companion while I switched countries and phone numbers. And oh, to make it easy for folks to remember, it's just my_first_name.my_last_name@gmail.com. \nGiven the dominance of GMail, I imagine this is true for most of us. So, there's an easily guessable email ID that is the thread linking all of my services together.\nBesides, it's not far fetched to say that this email address has been my defacto online identity.\nWhat is authentication and why is it using my identity?\nWe all accept that services need to authenticate us before they will grant access. Most of us have password managers with hundreds of websites, perhaps 10s of passwords, a couple of email IDs and may be one phone number.\nSo, essentially, the act of logging into a service as me (or you) consists mostly of guessing my password. Which is to say that the username/password form may as well be just a password form. \nOf course, this is not without flaws.\n\nThere's some entropy from having two fields to guess instead of one. \nMany of us have the same passwords so the username is essential to tell us apart.\n\nThere's a better model v2. This time with a maybe.\nMy challenge, and perhaps yours, is that we make profiling far too easy by using the same identity across services. Given the context of centralised apps, I see a few potential solutions. \nContainerised Identities\nIn this scenario, we create separate identities for each service we sign up for. Kind of like first_name+netflix@gmail.com except perhaps a bit more clever. \nI recently switched to using Tutanota with a custom domain as my email service. So any x@tejpochiraju.in is a valid email ID. With some simple filters, I catch subscriptions, bills and randoms in different folders. \nI could then use netflix@tejpochiraju.in, dropbox@tejpochiraju.in and so on to keep my identities siloed. That is until some clever sod figures out the domain name part of it. \nThe domain name is also the primary problem with scaling my approach - how many folks have and set up their own email domains?\nAlternatively, how about asking our browsers to generate a unique login id along with the password for each sign up? This would work - if we didn't ever need that password reset link sent to a working email.\nUnique Passwords For All\nTypically, authentication systems enforce uniqueness on the username. We could enforce it on the password instead. This makes the username field redundant. \nThis does not have to be a race where the first person to use password123 gets to use it. There are simple existing methods that could work.\nThe most popular of these is the Universally unique identifier UUID. This is a 36 character string that looks like this: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000.\n\nWhile the probability that a UUID will be duplicated is not zero, it is close enough to zero to be negligible. - Wiki Pedia\n\nAssuming we are all using password managers (and we should be), remembering this sequence is a job we leave to tools.\nBut most apps don't need 36 character passwords to ensure uniqueness. Blokada uses 12 character codes. With lowercase/ uppercase letters and digits, this allows 62^12 = 3226266762397899821056 unique codes. Should suffice for a long while yet!\nCryptographic Keys\nAssymetric cryptography using public/private key pairs has been used to secure protocols such as ssh, MQTT and even Bitcoin. This post is already too long to go into details here but suffice to say that:\n\nYou could generate a unique key for each service\nGive the public key to the service to store\nEach time you want to access the service, engage in a complex handshake that proves you are the owner of the private key\nGain access\n\nThis is perhaps the most secure and private authentication system we know. Admittedly, this is a more complex paradigm shift. Our browsers and web services are not built for this mode of authentication. But, perhaps, the day is not too far where we may need them to be.\nWhere do we go from here?\nFor the moment, I have made the following choices:\n\nWhere an email or phone number is not mandatory, I don't give one. Even if this means I can't receive password reset emails.\nWhere an email is necessary, I use servicename@tejpochiraju.in\nI am trying to minimise services that require my phone number.\nI secure my passwords using a password manager and a secure backup, just in case.\n\nI am still finding my feet with these topics so if you have insights and reads for me please do share at privacy@tejpochiraju.in.\n","id":"https://tej.sh/blog/identity/","title":"Decoupling authentication and identity"},"https://tej.sh/blog/layered-architecture-frappe/":{"body":"Being different is table stakes for web frameworks. And Frappe is more different than most. There was a time when Frappe's architecture diagram was one of the first things you saw in the documentation and understanding it was key to get started. Today, it's buried a long, long way down in the table of contents - presumably as part of an effort to make the framework seem less daunting.\nFrappe's revolutionary concept, besides being metadata driven, is the use of apps to organise functionality. Frappe itself is an app and all other apps depend on the Frappe app. A typical deployment or site will contain multiple apps that together provide the functionality that the site needs. The most common, and certainly the largest, Frappe app is ERPNext. When you need to provide customer specific ERPNext functionality, you install Frappe, ERPNext and your custom app that depends on these two. The application stack looks like this:\n\n  \n    Custom App\n  \n  \n    ERPNext\n  \n  \n    Frappe\n  \n\nIn this stack, Frappe knows nothing about ERPNext or your custom app. ERPnext depends on Frappe but knows nothing about your custom app. Your custom app depends on Frappe and ERPNext. So on and so forth.\nThis is how I have been building Frappe apps, with or without ERPNext, for 5 years now. And until yesterday, I didn't realise that this follows the best practices of layered architecture. Even Frappe's documentation does not mention layering once. On reflection, I think this architecture is what makes working in Frappe so productive.\n\nAnd, very, occasionally hairy when something you don't control shifts from underneath you.\n\nInversion Of Control\nLayering is not all rosy though. As the Kraken Tech blog above notes, layering also induces incentives to make the top layers heavier. This obviously reduces code reuse. The approach they suggest to counteract this tendency is to use Inversion Of Control. Another phrase that I had heard in passing but never explored or understood. \nAnd once you read about it, you realise that this is implemented in Frappe too and we use it on a daily basis. hooks are essentially Frappe's way to provide inversion of control. \n  graph TD;\n    CustomApp-- depends --&gt;Frappe;\n    Frappe-. hooks .-&gt;CustomApp;\n\nNow, I realise that most frameworks have event hooks but few have it for the number of events that Frappe does. Event hooks allow for some pretty great customisability. Especially when paired with overrides for DocType classes and Form scripts.\n\nWe use overrides for classes and scripts very sparingly because it's easy to lose track of where some custom behaviour is coming from. Instead, we abstract some of these use cases into separate DocTypes, e.g. a User Profile linked to each User.\n\nImplementing Your Own Hooks\nFor one of our applications, we wanted to provide a way for customer specific functionality to be added. Specifically, in this case, we needed to add custom validation to some APIs. Digging in the Frappe code base, we found frappe.get_attr. This function converts a dotted string path into a module or function that you can then execute. Here's how you use it.\nAdd a place to define hooks\n\nUse the hook in your API function\n@frappe.whitelist()\ndef record_events(**kwargs):\n    try:\n        prefix = kwargs.get('activity').lower().replace(\" \", \"_\")\n        hook = frappe.db.get_single_value(\n            \"IoTReady Traceability Settings\", f\"{prefix}_event_hook\"\n        )\n        hook_result = None\n        if hook:\n            hook_result = frappe.get_attr(hook)(kwargs)\n        result = some_function(kwargs)\n        if hook_result:\n            result.update(hook_result)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"Exception in record_events: \", str(e))\n        result = {\"success\": False, \"message\": str(e)}\n    return result\n\nNow, obviously, you have to implement the hook somewhere. We usually do this in a customer-specific application, iotready_godesi in the screenshot above.\nPros &amp; Cons Of Inversion Of Control\n\n+ Using inversion of control allows you to use core APIs (and UIs) as they are and build/test your custom functionality independently.\n+ This allows for significant code reuse and keeps customer-specific code out of your core functionality.\n- It does however mean that some functionality is harder to build and may require future, unforeseen requirements to the core functionality. \n- All changes to the core have to be carefully evaluated to avoid impacting other customers.\n\nConclusions\nLayering and inversion of control are both very useful architectural principles for structuring code - especially when you are in a B2B space like us and often need customer-specific functionality. \nOur code base is small enough that making changes to follow these principles is not too difficult. Frappe encourages these architectures so we are on solid ground already. \nFor the reasons listed above vis-a-vis inversion, we now lean towards using the layered approach as a default and use inversion of control as a pragmatic escape hatch. This means, for instance, that we are evaluating a small API rewrite so that the record_events API is exposed via the customer app rather than our core traceability app. More when we complete our evaluation.\n","id":"https://tej.sh/blog/layered-architecture-frappe/","title":"Layered Architecture With Frappe"},"https://tej.sh/blog/metabase-in-frappe/":{"body":"Since we collect a lot of operational data, it's inevitable that we do a lot of analysis and visualisation too. Our preferred tool for such analyses is Metabase.\nA typical IoTReady workflow solution, e.g. for Warehouse Traceability, works as described below:\n\nDesk-based staff log into our Frappe applications and modify configuration data (Supplier, SKU...)\nWarehouse floor staff use our hardware and mobile applications to carry out operations.\nOperational data flows into our events infrastructure, Bodh.\nValidations are carried out against the customer's configuration data using a rules engine.\nMetabase is used to make sense of the large volume of data by carrying out aggregations and comparisons (e.g. Transferred Out vs Transferred In).\n\nWhile we could leave it at this, asking users to go to a separate Metabase instance just for the couple of reports that role might need seems unnecessary. Besides, filtering questions and dashboards inside Metabase based on roles in Frappe would need mapping of all the roles and all the users.\n\n&lt;iframe&gt;s &amp; Filters\nThere's a simpler way to approach this:\n\ncreate a Metabase dashboard with the appropriate filters and enable them for embedding.\nembed the dashboard in Frappe using an &lt;iframe&gt;. \nuse Frappe roles and Metabase dashboard filters to show the users only what they need/are allowed to see.\nabstract this pattern to embed multiple dashboards.\n\nThe Metabase setup is quite simple and well documented. The important things to note are the Editable filters and enabling embeds in your global configuration. Once you have done this, you need to note your dashboard ID (shown in the URL as well as the Code tab).\n\nOn the Frappe side, we create a Page that calls some Python code upon loading.\n// Page\nfrappe.pages['warehouse-summary'].on_page_load = function (wrapper) {\n\tfrappe.call({\n\t\tmethod: \"app.utils.get_warehouse_dashboard\",\n\t\ttype: \"GET\",\n\t\targs: {},\n\t\tcallback: (r) =&gt; {\n\t\t\t// console.log(\"result\", r);\n\t\t\tif (r.exc) {\n\t\t\t\tconsole.error(\"error\", r.exc);\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t$(wrapper).html(r.message);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\tfreeze: false,\n\t\tfreeze_message: \"\",\n\t\tasync: true,\n\t});\n}\n\nThe Python function (get_warehouse_dashboard in this case) is page specific. This function's job is map to the right dashboard, generate the filters and call a more general function get_metabase_dashboard. This function generates the JWT token needed to load a dashboard from our Metabase instance, creates a custom &lt;iframe&gt; url and renders some HTML with this &lt;iframe&gt;.\n# Controller code\nimport frappe\nimport jwt\nimport time\n\n@frappe.whitelist()\ndef get_warehouse_dashboard():\n    dashboard_id = 3\n    roles = frappe.get_roles(frappe.session.user)\n    if (\n        \"BIG BOSS\" in roles\n    ):\n        params = {}\n    else:\n        # get_list filters Warehouse by user specific permissions.\n        warehouses = [r[0] for r in frappe.get_list(\"Warehouse\", as_list=True)]\n        params = {\"warehouse\": warehouses}\n    return get_metabase_dashboard(dashboard_id, params)\n\ndef get_metabase_dashboard(dashboard_id: int, params={}):\n    METABASE_SITE_URL = frappe.conf[\"metabase_site_url\"]\n    METABASE_SECRET_KEY = frappe.conf[\"metabase_secret_key\"]\n    payload = {\n        \"resource\": {\"dashboard\": dashboard_id},\n        \"params\": params,\n        \"exp\": round(time.time()) + (60 * 10),  # 10 minute expiration\n    }\n    token = jwt.encode(payload, METABASE_SECRET_KEY, algorithm=\"HS256\")\n\n    iframeUrl = (\n        METABASE_SITE_URL + \"/embed/dashboard/\" + token + \"#bordered=false&amp;titled=false\"\n    )\n    html = frappe.render_template(\n        \"templates/includes/metabase_dashboard.html\",\n        {\"iframeUrl\": iframeUrl, \"title\": \"Dashboard\"},\n    )\n    return html\n\n\nAnd here's the HTML template. The embedded script makes the iframe responsive.\n&lt;!-- template --&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=\"{{iframeUrl}}\" style=\"width: 100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" allowtransparency\n    id=\"Iframe\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n    // Selecting the iframe element\n    var frame = document.getElementById(\"Iframe\");\n    // Adjusting the iframe height onload event\n    frame.onload = function ()\n    // function execute while load the iframe\n    {\n        // set the height of the iframe as&nbsp;\n        // the height of the iframe content\n        frame.style.height =\n            frame.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px';\n        // set the width of the iframe as the&nbsp;\n        // width of the iframe content\n        frame.style.width =\n            frame.contentWindow.document.body.scrollWidth + 'px';\n    }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nNotes\n\nThis works well in a desktop layout but Metabase dashboards are not a great fit for mobile (even with the responsive code above).\nTest your filters thoroughly - especially if you are at risk of leaking sensitive information, e.g. in a multi-tenant environment.\nIf exposing the Metabase instance directly to customers, it's nicer to hide all tables by default and only enable the ones you want to showcase.\n\n","id":"https://tej.sh/blog/metabase-in-frappe/","title":"Embedding Metabase Dashboards In Frappe"},"https://tej.sh/blog/newspapers-privacy/":{"body":"I am a Gaurdian reader.

(OK, I would if I didn't have an adblocker.)\n\n\n\nThe point I am clumsily trying to make is that I pay but I don't sign in. \n\nWhen I don't sign in, I have the option/notion of rejecting all tracking. Once I sign in, all bets are off.\n\n\nThankfully, the Guardian only has annoying ads and not a paywall. Unlike the other newspapers I subscribe to.\nNewspaper I pay forCan I read without logging in?\nThe HinduNo\nThe New York TimesNo\nWall Street JournalNo\nLive MintYes\nThe GuardianYes\n\nWhy do newspapers want you to sign in?\nThe obvious, if naive, explanation is that you need to answer are you a subscriber?. This is essentially the AAA problem:\n\nAuthentication\nAuthorisation\nAccounting\n\nBut the answer to the question above is solely Authorization. You don't really need Authentication or Accounting. \n\n\nThe question Authentication answers is Who are you?. \n\n\nAccounting answers What and how much are you consuming?\n\n\nSure, some degree of Accounting may be needed for tiered access and so on, but last I checked none of these sites offer anything of the kind.\nSo, why do they really need AAA?\nI don't know the answer. But I can guess. It's because they really do want the answers to the age old questions:\n\nWho are you?\nWhy are you here?\n\nEither that or they have a bunch of lazy coders.\nBecause there's a better model\n\nLet me introduce you to Blokada. I have been using it for a couple of years to block trackers and ads on my phone. A few months ago, with the WeChat ban in India, I signed up for Blokada Plus. This gives me access to the toggle button at the bottom of that screen.\n\nBlokada works on my phone, on my web browser and my desktop. And it does not know who I am. \n\nHow does it do that?\nBy asking the only question it needs to, Are you a subscriber?.\nAnd when it does, I provide my unique, randomly generated, 12 character account ID and all is good.\nTo access the VPN from my desktop, I log into the web interface with, you guessed it, the account ID. Once logged in, I can generate cryptographic client certificates to use with my VPN client.\n\nWhat's the catch?\n\nIn theory, this model is no more immune to tracking than any other. \n\n\nBlokada has a payment processor who did receive some of my identity and card information - I didn't choose the  BTC payment option.\nThe payment processor could have shared this information with Blokada.\nBlokada could link the \"private\" account ID with the identity information. \nBlokada could, right now, be compiling a dossier on every site and app I use.\n\nBUT...\n\nIn practice, it is possible to make the system pretty rugged. \n\nLet's imagine a much more private flow for my beloved Guardian.\n\nI get tired of the half-page banners/want to encourage better journalism and opt to subscribe. \nThe Guardian clears all identifying cookies and session data about me from my browser and their servers.\nI am redirected to a privacy focused payment processor who doubles as an IDP.\n\nUPI, this is not.\n\n\nThe payment processor generates a unique ID and sends it to Guardian Towers who then present it to me and make me promise to keep it safely. \n\nThis could even be a long, memorable phrase.\n\n\nI log into Guardian on all three devices I own with this unique ID.\nThe Guardian verifies that the ID is kosher with our SuperPrivatePaymentProcessor.\nI rest easier knowing that Barney Ronay will never know that I read every one of his articles. \n\nIt's not that hard.

Some will make a mark on their chosen field. The rest, as someone eloquently put, will transfer bones from one graveyard to another. Indeed, one of the things you learn very early during doctoral studies is that no one other than you, your supervisor and your examiner is likely to ever read your thesis.\nHowever, that’s not the attitude the typical PhD student has at the beginning. First semester parties, yes we did have parties, are filled with people boasting about their respective research topics. You have the physicist who’s working on the next ultra-light material for airplanes, the musician who wants to create music through gestures rather than instruments and of course the historian who wants to study the progress in Anglo-Irish peace talks between April, 1981 and June, 1983.\nWhat none of them knows is that each of them is going to be humbled over the next 3 years. Some will give up. Some will go insane. Every one of them will age very rapidly.\nBecause, one thing that comes guaranteed with doctoral studies is insecurity. Once you realise that your work is unlikely to shake the world, you start doubting yourself. You question the genius that is your ego.\nThe first question which inevitably hits you towards the end of the first year is, is my topic even worth researching? I am an engineer. I have the comfort blanket of knowing that a thousand other researchers are trying to do the same thing I am. We can’t all be wrong.\nSoon after you have accepted the relevance of the research topic you begin to question your ability. Is my work good enough? And this is where PhD students earn their corn. This question is what drives you to spend 14 hours a day working in your lab for the whole of the second year. I haven’t yet met a second year PhD student who is satisfied with the quality of his work.\nAnd then there is the final year when you don’t care whether the topic is relevant or if you are! You just want some results so that you can start writing the damn thesis. And once you start writing the thesis, you lose touch with everything and everyone around you. You give up Beatles songs in the shower for the introduction to Chapter 3. You forget which of your friends was recently engaged, had a kid or came out of the closet. You stop shaving because you rarely leave the house. And when you do, it is to celebrate a completed chapter. Everything in your life revolves around that bloody thesis. That beautiful thesis.\nBecause the day you print your thesis and submit it to the university is the most beautiful day you will have known for nigh over 3 years. It’s the day you welcome friends back into your life. The day you sit in the Botanical gardens sipping 5 year old Chardonnay. The day our historian friend cherishes and dreads in equal measure. You see, while the rest of the doctoral students toil for three years knowing that they will have a job lined up, the historian knows that his job prospects are worse than that of England winning the next football world cup. That is to say, not very good at all.\nThe sad truth is, here in the UK, historians who have picked up undeniable project management skills and proven them repeatedly over 3 years have been squeezed out of the job market. Too inexperienced to teach or research, too qualified to sit at receptions. A well-regarded English historian is said to have lamented that Indians have no regard for history. It is a poor state of affairs that the British today have too many historians and no regard for any of them. How an upstart 21 year old adrenaline junkie gambling with the world’s finances is worth £50000 a year is something I will never understand. At the same time there are thousands of qualified social scientists out there serving fries or working the tills at Tesco.\nSo the next time a PhD is packing your groceries, spare a moment to discuss the socio-economic impact of the cucumber e-coli saga. Or better still, offer them a job.\nThis essay is adapted from a talk I gave at my erstwhile Rotary club — Melton Aurora.\n","id":"https://tej.sh/blog/phd/","title":"PhD, Bloody Hell!"},"https://tej.sh/work/":{"body":"My work so far can be seen as a progression from the lower tiers of \nTechnology Readiness Levels to \nhigher, market-ready tiers. I expect that I will return to lower tiers in the future. \n2018 -\n\nTRL 7 - 9\n\nI run IoTReady.co where we build simple,\nindustrial-grade IoT products. \nOur focus is on intelligent, single-purpose edge computing devices such as RFID readers,\nbarcode scanners, print controllers &amp; data loggers. Most of our hardware is built using microcontrollers\nand C with some built using GNU/Linux and single-board computers. Our core cloud platform is \nbuilt using Elixir and our workflow solutions are built using Python. I spend my time between sales, marketing,\ncloud infrastructure, GNU/Linux, Python and Elixir. As a (profitable) bootstrapped venture, my job is\nto ensure Traceable Quality™, keep our heads above water and groom people to replace me in various contexts.\n2014-2019\nPartly to recover from burnout and partly to build a loosely-coupled innovation ecosystem, \nI ran Jaaga Startup - India's oldest coworking community for entrepreneurs. \nI took over from the founders and built a curated, sustainable community that helped \neach other grow through skill and network sharing. I handed the reins back once the itch to build \nproducts overpowered the itch to build communities. Also, while aligning startups for collaborations\nis easy enough if your curation is strong, turning this into a monetisable model is much tougher.\n2013 - 2014\nI co-founded beyon:labs, a naive precursor to IoTReady. I sought out the best golang developer I could find, \nSathish VJ, and convinced him that building more intelligence at the Edge was the future (when everything was \nmoving to the cloud). beyon didn't survive the first monetary and resource allocation hiccups \nbut provided the \"do not do\" list for IoTReady.\n2013-2015\n\nTRL 3 - 6\n\nI ran micrograce - an RF &amp; Microwave focused new product development studio. \nWe built and sold 4 patents across UHF RFID and microwave processing of shoes. \nI started up because I believed there was a more efficient way to innovate than \nwhat I had observed in the EU funded project world. I worked on much the same things as at Pera, except \nwith the highly recommended constraints of fewer resources. micrograce brought me to Bangalore.\n2010-2012\n\nTRL 3 - 6\n\nI was a Senior Technologist at Pera Technology in Melton Mowbray with a responsibility for leading \nRF &amp; Microwave delivery. Most of the projects were funded by the EU. I was lucky enough \nto have worked across 30+ projects with 100+ SME partners. And unlucky, or bad, enough to have\nno patents and only 1 paper to show for the time.\n2009 - 2010\n\nTRL 1 - 3\n\nI worked as Postdoctoral Fellow on near field imaging (among some other things) with my \nresearch group at Queens. Some time during this phase is when I realised I wanted to be \nfurther up the TRL levels. Sadly, this meant leaving Belfast - a place I continue to miss.\n2006 - 2009\n\nTRL 1 - 3\n\nI worked towards my PhD thesis at Queen's Belfast - on the design and applications of Impedance Tuners. \nI started my PhD with work on Road Surface Imaging by adapting acoustic holography techniques\nbut soon realised that the work would need programming ability that I didn't yet have. I took the \neasy way out and worked on (passive and analog) hardware design.\n2004 - 2006\nI received my Masters in Microwave Engineering from IIT Kharagpur. I helped start the \nstudent-led GNU/Linux Users Group which in turn led to a job offer with a fast track to \nthe IT Head role. I went down a different path. Today, I administer all our servers. Full circle?\nPre 2004\nI got my Bachelor's in Engineering (Electronics &amp; Communications) at a random college in the Bombay\nUniversity system. I did get the privileges to manage the computer lab on account of being the only\nstudent with reasonable GNU/Linux skills and spare time. A pretty good score in a competitive\nexam meant I could have gone to medical school if I wanted to. A pass score in Biology meant that \nI realised a) I was unfit for medical school and b) not all competitive exams are equal.\n","id":"https://tej.sh/work/","title":"Work"}},"docInfo":{"https://tej.sh/":{"body":60,"title":2},"https://tej.sh/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://tej.sh/blog/crowdfund/":{"body":188,"title":2},"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-after-install/":{"body":261,"title":4},"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-cached-doc/":{"body":180,"title":4},"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-deferred-bulk/":{"body":466,"title":4},"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-integration-logs/":{"body":326,"title":6},"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-missing-utils/":{"body":398,"title":5},"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-otp-auth/":{"body":269,"title":4},"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-realtime/":{"body":289,"title":3},"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-restic/":{"body":434,"title":5},"https://tej.sh/blog/frappe-user-doctype-report/":{"body":120,"title":5},"https://tej.sh/blog/github-lessons/":{"body":190,"title":5},"https://tej.sh/blog/graceful-gunicorn/":{"body":292,"title":4},"https://tej.sh/blog/identity/":{"body":518,"title":3},"https://tej.sh/blog/layered-architecture-frappe/":{"body":460,"title":3},"https://tej.sh/blog/metabase-in-frappe/":{"body":405,"title":4},"https://tej.sh/blog/newspapers-privacy/":{"body":307,"title":4},"https://tej.sh/blog/phd/":{"body":378,"title":3},"https://tej.sh/work/":{"body":423,"title":1}},"length":20},"lang":"English"};
