- Need > Idea > Technology
- Frugal iterations beat 2 year plans.
- Build products. And product builders.
- APIs > SDKs


I co-founded and run [IoTReady.co](https://iotready.co) where we use these principles to build
best-in-class connected products.

I have been building connected products for 16 years, using GNU/Linux for 25 years (Arch 
for the last 18) and still often find myself googling grep/awk flags. 

I do a lot more coding these days than hardware design - mostly in Elixir and Python.
