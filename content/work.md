My work so far can be seen as a progression from the lower tiers of 
[Technology Readiness Levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level) to 
higher, market-ready tiers. I expect that I will return to lower tiers in the future. 


## 2018 -
> TRL 7 - 9

I run [IoTReady.co](https://iotready.co) where we build [simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4),
industrial-grade IoT products. 
Our focus is on intelligent, single-purpose edge computing devices such as RFID readers,
barcode scanners, print controllers & data loggers. Most of our hardware is build using microcontrollers
and C with some built using GNU/Linux and single-board computers. Our core cloud platform is 
built using Elixir and our workflow solutions are built using Python.

## 2014-2019

I ran [Jaaga Startup](https://jaaga.in) - India's oldest coworking community for entrepreneurs. 
I took over from the founders and built a curated, sustainable community that helped 
each other grow through skill and network sharing.

## 2013-2015
> TRL 3 - 6

I ran micrograce - an RF & Microwave focused new product development studio. 
We built and sold 4 patents across UHF RFID and microwave processing of shoes. 
I started up because I believed there was a more efficient way to innovate than 
what I had observed in the EU funded project world. micrograce brought me to Bangalore.

## 2010-2012

I was a Senior Technologist at Pera Technology in Melton Mowbray with a responsibility for leading 
RF & Microwave delivery. Most of the projects were funded by the EU. I was lucky enough 
to have worked across 30+ projects with 100+ SME partners. And unlucky, or bad, enough to have
no patents and only 1 paper to show for the time.

## 2009 - 2010
> TRL 1 - 3

I worked as Postdoctoral Fellow on near field imaging (among some other things) with my 
research group at Queens. Some time during this phase is when I realised I wanted to be 
further up the TRL levels. Sadly, this meant leaving Belfast - a place I continue to miss.


## 2006 - 2009
> TRL 1 - 3

I worked towards my PhD thesis at Queen's Belfast - on the design and applications of Impedance Tuners. 
I started my PhD with work on Road Surface Imaging by adapting acoustic holography techniques
but soon realised that the work would need programming ability that I didn't yet have. I took the 
_easy_ way out and worked on (passive and analog) hardware design.


## 2004 - 2006

I received my Masters in Microwave Engineering from IIT Kharagpur. I helped start the 
student-led GNU/Linux Users Group which in turn led to a job offer with a fast track to 
the IT Head role. I went down a different path. Today, I administer all our servers. Full circle?
