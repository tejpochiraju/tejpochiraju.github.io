<p>I am a <em>Gaurdian</em> reader. Have been since 2006. </p>
<p>I am a Guardian subscriber. Have been, on &amp; off, since they introduced subscriptions.</p>
<p>I still see this banner every time I go to the site. (OK, I would if I didn't have an adblocker.)</p>
<p><img src="/images/guardian_subscriber_plea.png" alt="Guardian Subscriber Plea" /></p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The point I am clumsily trying to make is that I pay but I don't sign in. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I don't sign in, I have the <em>option</em>/<em>notion</em> of rejecting all tracking. <strong>Once I sign in, all bets are off.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/guardian_privacy_settings.png" alt="Guardian Privacy Settings" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Thankfully, the Guardian only has annoying ads and not a paywall. Unlike the other newspapers I subscribe to.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Newspaper I pay for</th><th>Can I read without logging in?</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>The Hindu</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>The New York Times</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wall Street Journal</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Live Mint</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Guardian</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2 id="why-do-newspapers-want-you-to-sign-in">Why do newspapers want you to sign in?</h2>
<p>The obvious, if naive, explanation is that you need to answer <code>are you a subscriber?</code>. This is essentially the AAA problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Authorisation</li>
<li>Accounting</li>
</ul>
<p>But the answer to the question above is <strong>solely</strong> <code>Authorization</code>. You don't <em>really</em> need Authentication or Accounting. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The question Authentication answers is <code>Who are you?</code>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accounting answers <code>What and how much are you consuming?</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, some degree of Accounting may be needed for tiered access and so on, but last I checked none of these sites offer anything of the kind.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-do-they-really-need-aaa">So, why do they really need AAA?</h2>
<p>I don't <strong>know</strong> the answer. But I can guess. It's because they really do want the answers to the age old questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Who are you?</code></li>
<li><code>Why are you here?</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Either that or they have a bunch of lazy coders.</p>
<h2 id="because-there-s-a-better-model">Because there's a better model</h2>
<img src="/images/blokada_home.png" alt="Blokada Home Screen" height="400" />
<p>Let me introduce you to <a href="https://blokada.org/#about">Blokada</a>. I have been using it for a couple of years to block trackers and ads on my phone. A few months ago, with the WeChat ban in India, I signed up for <code>Blokada Plus</code>. This gives me access to the toggle button at the bottom of that screen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blokada works on my phone, on my web browser and my desktop. And it does not know who I am. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="how-does-it-do-that">How does it do that?</h3>
<p>By asking the only question it needs to, <code>Are you a subscriber?</code>.</p>
<p>And when it does, I provide my unique, randomly generated, <code>12 character account ID</code> and all is good.</p>
<p>To access the VPN from my desktop, I log into the web interface with, you guessed it, the account ID. Once logged in, I can generate cryptographic client certificates to use with my VPN client.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blokada_web.png" alt="Blokada Web Login" /></p>
<h2 id="what-s-the-catch">What's the catch?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In theory, this model is no more immune to tracking than any other. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Blokada has a payment processor who did receive some of my identity and card information - I didn't choose the  BTC payment option.</li>
<li>The payment processor could have shared this information with Blokada.</li>
<li>Blokada could link the &quot;private&quot; account ID with the identity information. </li>
<li>Blokada could, right now, be compiling a dossier on every site and app I use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="but">BUT...</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In practice, it is possible to make the system pretty rugged. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's imagine a much more private flow for my beloved Guardian.</p>
<ul>
<li>I get tired of the half-page banners/want to encourage better journalism and opt to subscribe. </li>
<li>The Guardian clears all identifying cookies and session data about me from my browser and their servers.</li>
<li>I am redirected to a privacy focused payment processor who doubles as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider">IDP</a>.
<ul>
<li><code>UPI, this is not.</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The payment processor generates a unique ID and sends it to Guardian Towers who then present it to me and make me promise to keep it safely. 
<ul>
<li>This could even be a <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">long, memorable phrase</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I log into Guardian on all three devices I own with this unique ID.</li>
<li>The Guardian verifies that the ID is kosher with our <code>SuperPrivatePaymentProcessor</code>.</li>
<li>I rest easier knowing that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barneyronay">Barney Ronay</a> will never know that I read every one of his articles. </li>
</ul>
<p>It's not that hard. We just need to take this shit seriously.</p>
